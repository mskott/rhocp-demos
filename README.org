* OpenShift demo setups

Heavily inspired by the [[https://github.com/rhpds/ocp-cluster-addons][OCP Cluster Addons]] repo this repo is intended to contain
resources for use on the Red Hat Demo Platform.

- ~aap/~ easy deployment of Ansible Automation Platform based on Helm and ArgoCD.
  Run ~oc create -f application-aap.yaml~ on a cluster with ArgoCD and AAP will
  be deployed.
- ~todo-app/~ simple web application using a database. Copied from the [[https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-gitops-workshop][GitOps workshop]].
  After deployment visit /todo.html - the app doesn't redirect.
